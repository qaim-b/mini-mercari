# 🏅 mini-mercari

This project aims to build and integrate ML, backend, and mobile services, always thinking about the user and business value.
It reflects Mercari’s values of ‘Go Bold’ (ML in production), ‘Move Fast’ (MVP-first, iterate), ‘All for One’ (documented, reusable, open source), and ‘Be a Pro’ (testing, clean code, real-world deployment).
I’m excited to bring these mindsets to real-world apps and try to bring new value for users.
